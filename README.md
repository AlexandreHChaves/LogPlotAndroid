# LogPlotAndroid


Library built from the ground to represent data in graphs with axis in logarithm and linear scale on Android systems.
In fact you can build an axis with any kind of scale, just extend Axis class. See the implementation of AxisLog as example.

I made it to support android version 16 and beyond. It doesn't have click events on graphics.

Below the general view of the grahics:
